## Technical Notes

### Color Space Handling
The implementation simulates Display P3 through selective color enhancement rather than true color space conversion, which would require platform-specific color management. This approach provides visually similar results while maintaining compatibility across devices.

### HDR Processing
The multi-frame HDR approach captures bracketed exposures and merges them using exposure fusion rather than true sensor HDR. This provides excellent results for static scenes and reasonable handheld performance.

### Performance Optimization
- Color processing uses optimized algorithms with early termination
- HDR capture can be disabled for faster standard photography
- Preview processing uses reduced resolution for real-time performance
- Memory management prevents accumulation during extended use
